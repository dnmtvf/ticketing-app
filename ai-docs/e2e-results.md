 # E2E Verification Results (Playwright MCP)
 
 Target: https://dnmtvf.a.pinggy.link
 Date: 2025-10-28
 
 Summary: Could not establish a connection to the provided Pinggy host from the MCP sandbox (ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED). As a result, end‑to‑end browser checks could not be executed from this environment.
 
 Attempts
 - GET / → net::ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED
 - GET /movies → net::ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED
 - GET over HTTP (http://dnmtvf.a.pinggy.link) → HTTP response failure
 - Repeated retries with waits → same outcome
 
 Next steps
 - Ensure the tunnel maps external 443/80 to your local Nuxt dev at 8282 and supports WebSocket/HTTP2 upgrades
 - Verify the Pinggy URL is publicly reachable (not IP‑restricted)
 - Alternatively provide a Cloudflare Tunnel or ngrok URL; I will rerun the Playwright checks immediately and append results here
 
 Notes
 - Local development on localhost:8282 works for you, but MCP runs remotely and cannot access your local 127.0.0.1; a public tunnel is required
 - Backend should remain accessible from the Nuxt server via http://localhost:3022 so proxying continues to work through the tunnel
